# goit-algo-hw-09

Two functions for the cash register system that gives change to the customer:
- using greedy algorithm,
- using dynamic programming.

Conclusions:
- with this particular solutions, the greedy algorithm  execution time is significantly better for small and large numbers,
- with coin "1" available and all coins as integers, the simple greedy algorithm will give the optimal solution.
